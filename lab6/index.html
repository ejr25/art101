		<h1>Lab 6: Arrays and Objects</h1>
		<p>Thursday October 20, 2022</p>

		<div id="sect-1">
			<h2>Challenge</h2>
			<p>Working with your partner, experiment with JavaScript arrays and objects.</p>
		</div>

		<div id="sect-2">
			<h2>Problems</h2>
			<p>The main problem I faced was figuring out how to have my script output show up on my homepage. I went to the discord and found 2 people with the same problems as me, however their solutions did not work. Finally my professor, Wes, helped me after the lecture and it turns out my document.writeln() line was written incorrectly in my lab.js file. I also had trouble having the image show up after I pushed to the origin.</p>
		</div>

		<div id="sect-3">
			<h2>Results</h2>
			<p>My results are here, displayed on this webpage.</p>
			<h3>Script Output:</h3>
				<div class=output>
					<script type="text/javascript" src="js/lab.js"></script>
				</div>
				<img id="my-car" src="img/my-car-l6.jpg"/>
		</div>
