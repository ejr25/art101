		<h1>Lab 8: Anon Functions and Callbacks</h1>
		<p>Tuesday October 25, 2022</p>

		<div id="sect-1">
			<h2>Challenge</h2>
			<p>Working with your partner, experiment with anonymous functions and callbacks.</p>
		</div>


		<div id="sect-2">
			<h2>Problems</h2>
			<p>The biggest problem I had in this lab was conceptualizing anon functions and callbacks. I needed to find an analogy that explained them to me, which Leslie helped with in section. I'm also having issues understanding why we linked the js file differently and why we want it to appear in the console only. I don't understand the point.</p>
		</div>


		<div id="sect-3">
			<h2>Results</h2>
			<p>My results are in the console and displayed here using document.getElementById()</p>
			<div id="output"></div>
		</div>
