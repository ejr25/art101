	<h1>Lab 3</h1>

	<div id="summ">
		<h2>Summary</h2>
		<p>The goal of this lab was to work on our main homepages and get more practice using HTML and CSS. There was also a focus on putting images into directories and correctly linking them. My partner mainly collaborated when we were stuck on something.</p>

		<h2>Difficulties</h2>
		<p>One difficulty I encountered was how to get super specific things to happen, before I realized I could put an ID on anything, including links. For example, I wanted to change the color of just one word. This sounds pretty obvious, but this is the lab where I really discovered what "HTML can get really specific" meant. Learning about IDs/classes in lecture is much different than starting to play with them in Atom. After that, I tried putting IDs on all my elements and it made it much easier to control very small pieces of my website. For example, I figured out how to change what links looked like and used that to make a hidden easter egg on my site. I’m also struggling with making photos look better. I wish there was a drag and drop feature on HTML, but of course that would mean there’s no code.</p>

		<h3>Task 2</h3>
		<p>Here is the screenshot of my browser (left) and source code (right) from my homepage. The screenshot doesn't capture it, but my homepage has a lot of CSS work done on the links. The color changes when you hover and is different from the resting, default appearance.</p>
