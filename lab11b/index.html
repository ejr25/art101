			<h2>Problems</h2>
			<p class="sect-text">Instead of changing the box of my sections I wanted to change the text color. This ended up being really hard, and I'm not sure why. When I compared it to the sample Lab 11 the logic seemed to line up. Then I decided to try again, this time following the lab instructions exactly, where I toggle the section boxes. Once again, I couldn’t get it to work. After trying for hours I decided to start from scratch and that's when all the issues magically went away. After comparing the two, I still can’t figure out what I was missing.</p>
