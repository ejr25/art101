		<div id="sect-2">
			<h2>Problems</h2>
			<p>I had some trouble with Task 2 and figuring out why my JS was not working. Using inspect, I saw there was an error in Line 14 and after debugging it I discovered I was using the incorrect quotation marks. I fixed that issue and there was another error, this time I made a typo when labeling a variable so I when I tried t reference it I couldn't since the names didn't match.</p>
