		<div id="sect-1">
			<h2>Challenge</h2>
			<p>Working with your partner, write functions that take user input and manipulate a string.</p>
		</div>


		<div id="sect-2">
			<h2>Problems</h2>
			<p>I was getting pretty frustrated that my JavaScript wouldn;t work before I realized it was due to a typo. I missed it when rereading my js file but I finally found it after inspecting it after viewing the lab7 site locally. I am also unsure how to get rid of the background from my image. I think I need an editor like PhotoShop because I saved it with a transparent background but it doesn't appear that way in HTML.</p>

			<h2>Results</h2>
			<p>My results are here, displayed on this webpage.</p>
